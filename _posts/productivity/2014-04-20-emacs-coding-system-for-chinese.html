<p>
As I'm using emacs under Windows 7, I want to correctly copy and paste
Chinese characters from or to emacs. The important settings are
language environment variables. Following code snippet is used to set
the default language environment in English and make use of utf-8
coding system as much as possible, while leaving the clipboard coding
system as utf-16le, which is the coding system used in Windows system
core:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Windows作業系統核心中的字元表示為UTF-16小尾序，可以正確處理、顯示以4位元組儲存的字元。<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(set-locale-environment <span style="color: #3a5fcd;">"English"</span>)
(set-language-environment 'English)
(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-file-name-coding-system 'gbk)
(set-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-clipboard-coding-system 'utf-16le)
(set-w32-system-coding-system 'utf-8)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
One benefit of using utf-16e while not chinese-gbk or chinese-gb18030
for clipboard coding system is that the special characters from French
and German are correctly copy/paste from/to emacs. While with
chinese-gbk/chinese-gb18030, only Chinese characters are encoded
correct, characters such as ß, ê are not displayed as expected when
copy from web browser.
</p>

<p>
Also please pay attention that the file name coding system is using
gbk which is used to display file names which Chinese
characters. Windows weirdly use gbk for file name coding other than
utf-16le. It is a painful experience to realize this issue.
