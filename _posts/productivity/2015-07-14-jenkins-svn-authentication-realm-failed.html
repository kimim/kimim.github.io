title: Authentication realm failed during SVN operation in Jenkins

<p>
I installed Jenkins on a Windows 7 machine, and use Jenkins bundled
SVNkit to check out source code from SVN repository. Source code
checking out is successful, after I put authentication user name and
password at the first checking out failure.
</p>

<p>
Later I want to get SVN statistic information by executing svn log
command as below:
</p>

<pre class="example">
C:\Jenkins\workspace\Application&gt;svn log "C:\Jenkins\workspace\Application" -v --xml 1&gt;"C:\Jenkins\workspace\Application\svn.log"
Authentication realm: &lt;http://kimi.im:80&gt; ?\147kimi.im?\148
Password for 'SYSTEM': Build was aborted
Aborted by kimi
Finished: ABORTED
</pre>

<p>
This command is pending that password is required. But I am calling
the batch by Execute Windows batch command, there is no way for me to
interactively type in user name and password.
</p>

<p>
From the log above, we can see that SYSTEM is the user running Jenkins
server by Windows. The solution that we try to execute SVN command
when we log in as SYSTEM.
</p>

<p>
There is one small tool named
PsTools(<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649.aspx">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649.aspx</a>),
which can be used to execute process with SYSTEM user.
</p>

<p>
Download PsTools and execute following command to run CMD with SYSTEM:
</p>

<pre class="example">
psexec -i -s cmd.exe
</pre>

<p>
<code>-i</code> means interactive, <code>-s</code> means SYSTEM.
</p>

<p>
Then execute SVN in cmd, and type correct user name and password. SVN
will save all the authentication information for your next execution.
