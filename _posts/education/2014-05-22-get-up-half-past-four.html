I've always planned to get up at half past four. Today, I wake up at
4:24 and after a short refresh, I get up at 4:30.
</p>

<p>
This idea is inspired by 中島孝志《朝4時起きの仕事術―誰も知らない「朝いちばん」活用法》<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>（4 點起床：最養生和高效的時間管理）<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Thus in fact I
get up half hour later than 4:00.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, after I wash up myself, there are more than two hours left for
me to make use of. During this time, I can read books, schedule my day
plan, write blogs, study languages, water my plants or cook breakfast
for my wife and daughter.
</p>

Yesterday, when I was in the shuttle bus back home, I was wondering
that I cannot find enough time to learn German and French. Because I
get office at 8:30, have lunch at 12:00 for half hour, and continue
work at 12:30, then leave office at 17:05. When I'm back to home, I
should drive to our parents' to have supper. And after that we play
with Vivi until 20:30 when Vivi fall sleep. Then we have one or two
hours free, but very tired. It is not a good idea to use brain
exhaustedly just before sleep.
</p>

<p>
So what? 2 hours in the morning(5:00~7:00) is the gold time learning
and creative activities.
</p>

<p>
BTW: It takes 40 minutes(5:00~5:40) for me to write this
article. Inefficient!
