最近在准备一个关于信息安全的培训，提到信息安全，就免不了要谈一谈
Stuxnet。那场攻击直接把伊朗核武器开发进度减慢了 1 整年。
</p>

<p>
Stuxnet hasn&rsquo;t vanished, but it is not a major cybersecurity threat
today. In fact, while Stuxnet grabbed a lot of headlines due to its
dramatic capabilities and <b>cloak-and-dagger</b> origins, it was never much
of a threat to anybody other than the Natanz facility that was its
original target.
</p>

<p>
因为 Stuxnet 是美国和以色列情报机构联合开发的，所以这段话里描述它是源自 <b>cloak-and-dagger</b> 披风与短剑是间谍常见的装扮，所以这个短语指间谍故事，也用来形容神神秘秘、鬼鬼祟祟的事情。
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m tired of all these <b>cloak-and-dagger</b> meetings - let&rsquo;s discuss the
issues openly. 我厌倦这种神神秘秘的会议了，让我们开诚布公地讨论吧。

<p>
In 1974, ballet star Baryshnikov defected from the Soviet Union. He
talks about his <b>cloak-and-dagger</b> escape. 芭蕾明星 Baryshnikov 通过一次秘密行动逃离苏联。
</p>

<p>
His <b>cloak-and-dagger</b> escape helped make him a cultural
celebrity. “Soviet Dancer in Canada Defects on Bolshoi Tour,” the New
York Times declared on its front page.
