最近看工业信息安全资料，读到这段：
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Stuxnet attack managed to silently <b>sabotage</b> centrifuges in a
uranium-enrichment plant by reading and writing code blocks on PLCs
from a compromised engineering workstation.
</p>

<p>
2010 年震网攻击通过破防的工作站，修改 PLC 的代码块，偷偷的蓄意毁坏伊朗的一个铀浓缩厂的离心机。
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
这里有一个单词 sabotage，跟之前介绍的 <a href="./2022-11-03-english-triage">triage</a> 的样子很像，也都是 -age
结尾的，也都是来自法语。
</p>

<p>
这个词的意思是 1）damage or destroy equipment, weapons, or buildings
in order to prevent the success of an enemy or competitor，通过蓄意破坏设施、武器、建筑从而阻止敌人、竞争者。 2）to intentionally prevent
the success of a plan or action，阻挠某个行动或计划。
</p>

<p>
我饶有兴致地查了下 sabot 的意思：
</p>

<p>
sabot is a kind of simple shoe, shaped and hollowed out from a single
block of wood, traditionally worn by French and Breton peasants. There
are two kinds of sabots: one is shaped and hollowed from a single
piece of wood (called klompen by the Dutch), and the other is a heavy
leather shoe with a wooden sole.
</p>

<p>
大致来说，sabot 是法国农民穿的木鞋。一种是以整块木头雕刻的，一种是木鞋底的皮鞋。顺便提一下，bot 在古法语里就是 boot（靴子）的意思。
</p>

<p>
最早的时候，sabotage 其实是一种相对温和的怠工行为：
</p>

<p>
SABOTAGE [chapter heading] The title we have prefixed seems to mean &ldquo;scamping work.&rdquo; It is a device which, we are told, has been adopted by certain French workpeople as a substitute for striking. The workman, in other words, purposes to remain on and to do his work badly, so as to annoy his employer&rsquo;s customers and cause loss to his employer. [The Liberty Review, January 1907]
</p>

<p>
因为老板给的待遇不好，所以法国的工人们消极怠工，穿着 sabot 制造出噪音，干扰客户，给老板造成损失。
</p>

<p>
后来不知道怎么的，sabotage 就成了蓄意破坏 malicious damaging or
destruction。
</p>

<p>
所以，saboteur 就是搞破坏的人，破坏分子。法语里还有 la saboteuse 女破坏分子，但是似乎没有引入英语。例如：
</p>

<p>
These networks are exceedingly easy to detect and, with poor design
and architecture added into the mix, can be highly susceptible to
eavesdropping and masquerade attacks by the curious and <b>saboteurs</b>
alike.
</p>

<p>
此外，saboteur 还是一种人格类型：
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Saboteurs tend to be loners, not because they don’t like other
people, but because they find it difficult to trust others.</li>
<li>They are constantly afraid of being taken advantage of or betrayed.</li>
<li>Saboteurs are often negative people who are always looking for the
worst in every situation.</li>
<li>They are quick to point out all of the faults in others and love to
gossip about them behind their backs.</li>
</ul>
