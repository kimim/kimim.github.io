<p>
Since July 1, I reached 8th year as a software engineer. I have worked
in Nokia Siemens Networks(now Nokia Solutions and Network) for 2 and
three quarters as platform system engineer and Scrum Master for the
team. And later on April 11, 2011, I joined ABB as automation system
software engineer and later promoted as team supervisor.
</p>

<p>
After taking management tasks for three years, I found that I am not
good in communication:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I cannot deliver positive messages to my boss. So I am always been
challenged even the bottle neck is not on me, and also I cannot win
more honor for my team.
</li>
<li>I cannot persuade myself to take lots of private time to business
dinner and other activities. I want my work and life are balanced.
</li>
<li>I prefer simple relationships not complex personal connections.
</li>
<li>I like information transparency. I am not able to hide information
and take advantage of the information asymmetry. I feel upset if
others take advantage of the asymmetry.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I will develop my management skills and at the same time, I will focus
on improving my technical expertise by concentration.
</p>

<p>
According to Robert Toru Kiyosaki's book "Rich Dad Poor Dad", the
management skills are categorized in to three areas:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>financial management
</li>
<li>time management
</li>
<li>people management
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For financial management, I will talk this in another article, because
it has less relationship with my current problems.
</p>

<p>
My problems are mainly in time management and people management,
especially in people management.
</p>

<p>
For people management skill improvement, I will:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>create a book list for different kind of management skills,
</li>
<li>subscript to podcast or video lessons for communication skill,
</li>
<li>and practise the management and communication theory and improve it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For time management skill, I have established the GTD system with
emacs and org-mode. I should try to make full use of GTD system and
continuously improve the system. With the help of GTD system, I can
make full use of my work time, and focus on accumulating technical
expertise experience. Then I can say I am working in high efficiency.
