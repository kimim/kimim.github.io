<p>
On the way to management role, you will soon find that it is quite
different from technical role. When there is disaster, people are not
going to take responsible and analyze their problem. The first resort
is to find execuse from others. They may look into history logs to
find your mistakes and put blame on you.
</p>

<p>
It really happens even though they used to be very nice
apparently. The root cause for someone to pass the buck is the fear of
failure. They are afraid of being blamed and dealing with the
overwhelmed situation.
</p>

<p>
In this case study, we can look from two point of view, and conclude
some learning points.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Stop passing the buck</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
For whatever reasons, when people are not taking responsibility, he
will fail in his work, lose respects from others, and fail to grow.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, you should start from the reality and analyze the cause of
the problem, while not find cues to blame other.
</p>

<p>
Then, based on the result of the analyzing, you should find any
actions you can do to create workaround, if the case is quite urgent.
</p>

<p>
After that, you shall list all the actions strategically, list item
by item, group to small project, prioritize them, and schedule them.
</p>

<p>
Finally, when you complete all the actions needed to solve the
problem, you should retrospect the problem, and find process
improvement to avoid the same problem in the future. At this point,
you could frankly and nicely provide suggestions to others if their
mistake leads to the problem. I think they will trust you and
appreciate your help.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Avoid being the scapegoat</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Well, as I mentioned in the beginning, there are always the guys who
will pass the buck to you. You should prepare for this in your work.
</p>

<p>
Here are some tips:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first thing you should always do is to be professional. Do not
leave the chance for others to blame you. That means you should
make high quality product. You should always improve your quality.
</li>
<li>Whatever risks you take, you should prepare for taking the
responsible. If others want you to rush for the deadline, you
should protect yourself. Otherwise, you can let others to write
down their responsible for the potential risk.
</li>
<li>Avoid being meek and submissive. If the criticism is unfair, you
should stand up. It is not the time to be nice. But you should
have the sufficient evidence that you are correct.
</li>
<li>Don't rush for fight, be cool, wait for enough supportive evidence
to fight.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Management role is always a dagerous role. It a long way for me to
be a professional manager.
