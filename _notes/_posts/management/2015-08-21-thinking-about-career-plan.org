Since July 1, I reached 8th year as a software engineer. I have worked
in Nokia Siemens Networks(now Nokia Solutions and Network) for 2 and
three quarters as platform system engineer and Scrum Master for the
team. And later on April 11, 2011, I joined ABB as automation system
software engineer and later promoted as team supervisor.

After taking management tasks for three years, I found that I am not
good in communication:
- I cannot deliver positive messages to my boss. So I am always been
  challenged even the bottle neck is not on me, and also I cannot win
  more honor for my team.
- I cannot persuade myself to take lots of private time to business
  dinner and other activities. I want my work and life are balanced.
- I prefer simple relationships not complex personal connections.
- I like information transparency. I am not able to hide information
  and take advantage of the information asymmetry. I feel upset if
  others take advantage of the asymmetry.

I will develop my management skills and at the same time, I will focus
on improving my technical expertise by concentration.

According to Robert Toru Kiyosaki's book "Rich Dad Poor Dad", the
management skills are categorized in to three areas:
- financial management
- time management
- people management

For financial management, I will talk this in another article, because
it has less relationship with my current problems.

My problems are mainly in time management and people management,
especially in people management.

For people management skill improvement, I will:
- create a book list for different kind of management skills,
- subscript to podcast or video lessons for communication skill,
- and practise the management and communication theory and improve it.

For time management skill, I have established the GTD system with
emacs and org-mode. I should try to make full use of GTD system and
continuously improve the system. With the help of GTD system, I can
make full use of my work time, and focus on accumulating technical
expertise experience. Then I can say I am working in high efficiency.
