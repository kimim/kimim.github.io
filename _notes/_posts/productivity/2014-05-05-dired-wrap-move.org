When the cursor is at the buffer end of =ibuffer=, it will wrap back
to the beginning of the buffer list if I continue pressing =n= to next
buffer. But in =dired=, this does not happen. The cursor will stay at
the end of the file list, if I continue pressing =n= to navigate to
next buffer.

Here is the trick to wind the cursor up to the first item of the file
list. I redefine the function =dired-next-line= and =dired-previous-line=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun dired-next-line (arg)
  "Move down lines then position at filename.
Optional prefix ARG says how many lines to move; default is one line."
  (interactive "p")
  (forward-line arg)
  (if (eobp)
      (progn
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (forward-line 2))) ;; skip two lines: file path and summary
  (dired-move-to-filename))

(defun dired-previous-line (arg)
  "Move up lines then position at filename.
Optional prefix ARG says how many lines to move; default is one line."
  (interactive "p")
  (if (= 3 (line-number-at-pos)) ;; line num of first item
      (progn
        (goto-char (point-max))
        (forward-line -1)) ;; skip the last empty line
    (forward-line (- arg)))
  (dired-move-to-filename))
#+END_SRC
