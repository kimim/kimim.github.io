Displaying [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Images.html][inline image]] in orgmode is useful. But when emacs theme is
dark theme and the image has transparent background, the image is
difficult to view.

To fix this problem, we can define an advice to filter the image from
~org--create-inline-image~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org--create-inline-image-advice (img)
  (nconc img (list :background "#f8f8f8")))
(advice-add 'org--create-inline-image
            :filter-return #'org--create-inline-image-advice)
#+end_src

~org--create-inline-image-advice~ adds ~:background~ to the image. ~#f8f8f8~
is the light white color I used for light theme.

~:filter-return~ is the ~where~ argument for ~advice-add~, this means the
advice function is applied to the result of the original function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(lambda (&rest r) (funcall advice-function (apply oldfun r)))
#+end_src

With the advice, the transparent background inline image looks the
same no matter light or dark theme.
