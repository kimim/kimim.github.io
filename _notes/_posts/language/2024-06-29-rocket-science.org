上周一周都在跟瑞典退休老专家学功能安全。功能安全老专家很喜欢说 it not
*rocket science*. 这不是火箭科学。确实，在功能安全领域，很多失效数据的估
计，并没有彻底的数学公式支撑，所以，不能算得上 *rocket science* 。

所谓 *rocket science* 就是 the science of designing or building rockets，
引申意为 something that is very difficult to learn or understand The
job is challenging, but it's not exactly rocket science.

比如：My coach always said, "Basketball is not *rocket science*. It's
about putting the ball in the basket."

其他相似的表达：

Learning German, it's *not like brain surgery*.

There is no challenge in this racing game, it's *a walk in the park*.

Learning how to ride a bike is *a piece of cake*, it just takes a little
practice.
