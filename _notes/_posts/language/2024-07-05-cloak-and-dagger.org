最近在准备一个关于信息安全的培训，提到信息安全，就免不了要谈一谈
Stuxnet。那场攻击直接把伊朗核武器开发进度减慢了1整年。

Stuxnet hasn't vanished, but it is not a major cybersecurity threat
today. In fact, while Stuxnet grabbed a lot of headlines due to its
dramatic capabilities and *cloak-and-dagger* origins, it was never much
of a threat to anybody other than the Natanz facility that was its
original target.

因为 Stuxnet 是美国和以色列情报机构联合开发的，所以这段话里描述它是源
自 *cloak-and-dagger* 披风与短剑是间谍常见的装扮，所以这个短语指间谍故事，
也用来形容神神秘秘、鬼鬼祟祟的事情。

I'm tired of all these *cloak-and-dagger* meetings - let's discuss the
issues openly. 我厌倦这种神神秘秘的会议了，让我们开诚布公地讨论吧。

In 1974, ballet star Baryshnikov defected from the Soviet Union. He
talks about his *cloak-and-dagger* escape. 芭蕾明星 Baryshnikov 通过一次
秘密行动逃离苏联。

His *cloak-and-dagger* escape helped make him a cultural
celebrity. “Soviet Dancer in Canada Defects on Bolshoi Tour,” the New
York Times declared on its front page.
