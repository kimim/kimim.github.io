There are several ways to install =clojure= on Linux and macOS, but
no Windows option. Anyway, =clojure= official site provide one
option to compile it with =maven=.

1. download =maven= from http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
2. unpack =maven= to some folder, such as =C:\apache-maven-3.6.3\bin=
3. add to =maven= to =PATH=, by add one line in =~/.bash_profile=:

   #+begin_src shell
   export PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin
   #+end_src

4. clone =clojure= src and compile with maven:

   #+begin_src shell
   git clone https://github.com/clojure/clojure.git
   cd clojure
   mvn -Plocal -Dmaven.test.skip=true package
   #+end_src

5. Then start the REPL with the local jar:

   #+begin_src shell
   java -jar clojure.jar
   #+end_src

Now, you are a happy clojurian!
