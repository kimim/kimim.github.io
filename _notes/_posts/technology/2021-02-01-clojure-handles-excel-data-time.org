Date and time is stored in excel as integer of float64 value. When you read them
in clojure, you need to convert it to date/date-time object.

For example, "2020-11-17T08:09:10.000" is stored as 44152.33969907 in Excel low
level.

You can use =cljc.java-time= [fn:1] to handle date and date time values.

Firstly, add the deps.

clj deps.edn:
#+begin_src clojure
{:deps
 {cljc.java-time/cljc.java-time               {:mvn/version "0.1.15"}}}
#+end_src

or leiningen project.clj:
#+begin_src clojure
(defproject excel-test "0.0.1"
  :dependencies [[cljc.java-time "0.1.15"]])
#+end_src

You can use the latest version:

[[https://clojars.org/cljc.java-time][https://clojars.org/cljc.java-time/latest-version.svg]]

Then let's calculate the 44152 or 44152.33969907 in local date or local date time.

There are a couple of additional caveats to be aware of before we try to convert
the dates:

- Excel counts 1900-01-01 as day 1 in itâ€™s serial calculation, so you need to
  ensure you are counting this extra day in any date difference calculations.
- The Excel date serial is off by 1, as it behaves as if 1900-02-29
  existed. This is due to a compatibility issue with Lotus 123 back when Excel
  was released and is a known issue[fn:2].

This means that the Excel date serial for a given day is off by 2 compared to
the actual amount of days that have elapsed since 1900-01-01.[fn:3] Thus, you
can calculate the date base on 1899-12-30.

#+begin_src clojure
(require '[cljc.java-time.local-date :as ld]
         '[cljc.java-time.local-date-time :as ldt]
         '[cljc.java-time.temporal.chrono-unit :as chrono-unit])

(-> (ld/parse "1899-12-30")
    (ld/plus-days
     44152))
;; => #object[java.time.LocalDate 0x499f935c "2020-11-17"]

(-> (ldt/parse "1899-12-30T00:00:00.000")
    (ldt/plus-nanos
     (* 1e9 60 60 24 44152.33969907))
    (ldt/truncated-to chrono-unit/millis))
;; => #object[java.time.LocalDateTime 0x7e8f1e44 "2020-11-17T08:09:09.999"]
#+end_src
